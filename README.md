# stateful-art-homepage
homepage of stateful.art project.

contains multiple states/variations/modes via taste in arts. 
after some point as page goes down, 
there exist multiple versions of the page, including $genre communities (orders, designs, all possible to change.)
we aim to curate as community and schedule future versions, design totaly new ones; this is just a concept. 

consider is like your coffeeshop selection, they could go text content, typography, font-types and what not.

future versions of those states will be accessible and deployed in a new branch, before they are switched to main branch.

soon there will be no limit to number of them a user can add and switch on their view, and instead of platform deciding, community deciding their identities and how they convey and express them.

thinking of using https://replit.com to keep them open open for demonstration and modification.
