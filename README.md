# art directed, multi-state homepage

homepage of stateful.art (aka. start) project. it's one of its kind, partially multi-state, dynamic and community-curated website.

soon page will become multi-language as well. 

contains multiple states/variations/modes via taste in arts. we reference to them, as art directions. 
clicked to images of those base $genre community, they dispatch to DAO, Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, currently defined for these genres, to illustrate and give a foundation.

Our mission, at start, is connecting cities with arts, and soon with rights/causes as well.
Here's link to #startDAO, that's behind all of these developments, 
networked with many individuals and communities on web2 and web3. 

project, and its home, https://stateful.art are artworks themselves.
you are welcome to become a contributor to this collective work, or suggest a feature, or start something new with that and concept, and let the world know about it. Don't forget to tell us as well, we'd most probably help starting or list your community on start's homepage. 

let your taste in the arts and cities/localities help bridging as well!

Feel welcomed to all those DAOs and be ready to receive and share $genre tokens, 
invite more artists for new cities started for each genre.

per including multiple movement/genres in their current state, the way communities of them desired and decided so.

after some point scrolling down, there exist multiple versions of the page, including $genre communities (orders, designs, all possible to change.)
we aim to curate as community and schedule future versions, design totaly new ones; this is just a concept. 

consider is like your coffeeshop selection, they could go text content, typography, font-types and what not.

future versions of those states will be accessible and deployed in a new branch, before they are switched to main branch.

soon there will be no limit to number of them a user can add and switch on their view, and instead of platform deciding, community deciding their identities and how they convey and express them.

on the side, also keeping a repl up to date with live one. Fork it, change content and it's yours! 

Let the world know about how you bridge people 
and create cool exchanges with arts of peace.
