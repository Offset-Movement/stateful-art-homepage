          “don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it
          grow, be like water.
          <br></br>
          empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water
          in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the
          bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow
          or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”
